            <p>The emotion map is a college project. The goal of this project was for each student to make his own map of Belgrade, the way he sees the city and how he feels in it, such as where he likes to eat, where he lives, where he met someone, etc. My map is represented by my personal emotions and how those places affect my emotions. I created each character that represents my emotion. They are fear, love, hunger, joy, sadness, anger, happiness. I printed the map at the end.</p>
