    <p>"Why such an 'About Me' page? Because I enjoy doing everything differently and creatively. Also, I believe it's important for potential clients to have some insight into who I am as a person if they're considering hiring me for their project, even if it's just these little things.... so hello, I'm Isidora, a student, graphic designer, web designer. What I love is drawing, doing everything related to design and creativity. I have knowledge in Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Procreate, HTML, CSS, a little bit in JavaScript, Figma, and a little bit in other design programs. Every day I work to improve myself and to do my best on every project I get. My email adress is isidoraa9620@gmail.com, feel free to contact me.</p>
